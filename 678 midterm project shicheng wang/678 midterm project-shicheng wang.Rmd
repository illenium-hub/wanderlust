# 1.Abstract
This is a statistical analysis report about NBA situation. The aim of this report is to develop series of methods to measure the comprehensive strengthes of players in NBA union and trying to figure out how each kind of player's abilities could influence his shooting results in the small ball era. Additionally, the project has also analyzed the strategies and preferences of players. Specifically, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and modeling are involved in this report. Overall, readers will get the general idea about how various elements influence players' shooting result.  

# 2.Introduction
## 2.1 Background
As NBA steps into a commercialize stage for almost 80 years, it have become a mature business alliance through decades' development, which has always been regarded as a focus and attracting bunches of capitals overseas. It is acknowledged that the players' performances is straightly related to the ratings and could determine the future of a team and related industries, making it is meaningful to conduct a depth analysis for these players' shooting ability.   
More importantly, NBA has experienced a huge change since 2014-2015 season. It could be attributed to the rise of three-point shooters leading by Curry and Tompson. Along with Golden State Warriors win the NBA championship finally,
it has initiated a new stage for NBA. That is to say, NBA has completed the transformation from old times (Tactical arrangement dominated by tall players inside the three-point line) to small ball era (Dominated by the three points shots outside the line). Hence, player's scoring choice would change since then.

## 2.2 Data sources
There are overall three datasets included in the report. For the EDA part, I will use NBA League Averages(season) which contains averages statistics of all players in NBA in each year to get the general idea of players' condition in the whole association throughout 70 years. This dataset is collected in Basketball Reference. Besides, I also use NBA Season Data(player) for EDA part to analyze players' performance throughout 70 years, and this dataset is collected in Pro Basketball Statistics. The main dataset(da) i used to further analyze is NBA Shot Logs during 2014-2015 season, this dataset detailly record each player's performance at each time period in each game, and this is collected in Kaggle, while they are originally scraped from NBA's REST API. The following are websites of each dataset.  

* NBA League Averages - Totals: [link](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_totals.htmlm)  
* NBA Season Data: [link](http://www.nbastats.net/)  
* NBA Shot Logs during 2014-2015 season: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs)  

## 2.3 Research question
For the former part of EDA in this project, I would analyze how players' characteristics and how average skill level could change throughout 70 years based on the relavant database. Main research question of this project is to analyze how each players' series of charactistics could influence the actural shooting ability in each single game.  

# 3.Methodology  
## 3.1 Data process
* Data access
Importing three datasets.
```{r}
team <- read.csv("/Applications/BU/BU/678 Applied Statistical Modeling/MA678 midterm project/678 midterm project shicheng wang/data/NBA League Averages.csv")
player <- read.csv("/Applications/BU/BU/678 Applied Statistical Modeling/MA678 midterm project/678 midterm project shicheng wang/data/Seasons_Stats.csv")
data <- read.csv("/Applications/BU/BU/678 Applied Statistical Modeling/MA678 midterm project/678 midterm project shicheng wang/data/shot_logs.csv")
```

* Data organize
```{r,include=FALSE}
### team data 
season <- na.omit(team[1:42,c(2,4,5,6,8:32)])
dim(season)
### reserse order
season <- arrange(season,season$X.1)
season <- season[c(-42),c(1,2,4,6:9,21:23)]
### rename variables
season <- plyr::rename(season,c(X.1="year",X.3="age",X.5="weight",X.7="fg_per",X.8="fg_aver",X.9="3g",
                                X.10="3a",Shooting="fg%",X.22="3p%",X.23="ft%"))
### variables adjust
season$help = 1
season$year = as.factor(season$year)
season$age = as.factor(season$age)
season$year <- substr(season$year,3,4)
season$year <- factor(season$year, as.character(season$year))
season$`3g` = as.numeric(as.character(season$`3g`))
season$`3a` = as.numeric(as.character(season$`3a`))
season$`3p%`= as.numeric(as.character(season$`3p%`))
```
_For the season average dataset, clear the NA data first and then reverse the data order by year, then select the columns which are going to be analyzed. In order to be easily understood, i rename the variables' name._  

```{r,include=FALSE}
### player data
player <- player[,c(1:6,11:13,35:40,53)]
players <- na.omit(player)
dim(player)
unique(players$Year)           # the new data contain all the players' comprehensive abilities form 2014-2016
### rename variable
players <- plyr::rename(players,c(X="number",Year="year",Player="player",Pos="position",Age="age",Tm="team",
                              TS.="trueshoot",X3PAr="3rate",FTr="ftrate",X3P="3goal",X3PA="3attempt",X3P.="3per",X2P="
                              2goal",X2PA="2attempt",X2P.="2per",PTS="point"))
```
_For NBA players dataset, drop out players whose data are incompelete. Then i get all players' dataset from 1980 to 2017. This dataset is used for analyzing player's preference and ability of shooting._   


For the main dataset, the data cleaning procession shows as below:
* Step1: cleaning    
```{r,include=FALSE}
### clear NA data
data <- na.omit(data)          # lose almost 6000 rows
                               # new data contain all the players' comprehensive abilities form 2014-2016
### check the distribution of players' shooting range
number <- count(data,player_name) 

### drop players' data whose shooting under 200 times(based on the former histgram).
newdata <- merge(number,data)
data <- filter(newdata,n>=200) # lose about 10000 rows
```

```{r}
### players data amount
hist(number$n, density = 3, col = "skyblue", main  = "density = 3")       
```
_Firstly, clearing the NA value, then calculate how many rows does each player have, and draw a barplot based on each player's data amount. Notice that several players have less than 200 rows which could hinder the modeling procession, so i drop these players._   

* Step2: adjustment  
```{r}
### select useful column
data <- dplyr::select(data,-n)
da <- data[,c(1,4,5,6,7,8,10:15,18)]

### rename variables' names 
library(reshape)
da <- plyr::rename(da,c(player_name="name",LOCATION="location",W="winlose",FINAL_MARGIN="margin",SHOT_NUMBER="shotnumber",PERIOD="period",SHOT_CLOCK="shotclock",DRIBBLES="dribble",TOUCH_TIME="touch",SHOT_DIST="range",PTS_TYPE="type",SHOT_RESULT="result",CLOSE_DEF_DIST="defence"))

### adjust variables
da$location=as.numeric(da$location)-1   # 1 for home, 0 for away
da$winlose=as.numeric(da$winlose)-1     # 1 for win, 0 for lose
da$result=2-as.numeric(da$result)       # 1 for made, 0 for miss
da$type=as.numeric(da$type)
```
_After organizing the dataset well, I select specific information and rename the variable name. Additionally, i adjust variables' value which could be beneficial for later analysis._  

* Data overview
The head of shot log.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(da), digits = 4, align = "c",
             caption = 'Overview of shot log',booktabs = TRUE)
```

Type variables's categories and overview.     
```{r}
kable(table(data$LOCATION))
kable(table(data$PERIOD))
kable(table(data$PTS_TYPE))
kable(table(data$SHOT_RESULT))
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
```
 
## 3.2 Variables interpretation

```
_For the weight aspect, we could see the weight requirement is incresing but there is an obvious decrease in 2012, it can be ascribed to the fact that the center dominate whole union until 2012 and then comes the small ball era, which rely more on light and flexible players to shooting 3-point shots. For the field goal condition, we could see it vibrate overyears and one characteristic is that the big drop 1990-2000, this is because players would like to concentrate more on defencing than offencing. For 3-point field goals, there exists steady increase in recent 30 years and the growth rate increases since 2012 due to the small ball era._

_Of all the players in the NBA from 1980 to 2017, their shooting trends are obvious. In the comparasion between 2-point field goals and 3-point field goal, we could see there exists decreasing in 2-point field goal attempts/goals and increasing in 3-point field goal attempts/goals. In the meantime, the 2-point field goal percentage keep steady, while the 3-point shooting quality increases to an upper level._   

## 4.3 Shooting preference 2014-2015 season.
* shoot type preference: It is well acknowledged that 2014-2015 season could be regarded as the beginning of the small ball era,
```{r}
### range preference
p13<-ggplot(da, aes(x=range)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=.5,colour="#CC6666", fill="#FFCC99") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#66CCFF")+
    geom_line(stat="density",colour="#990033")
### shotclock preference
p14<-ggplot(da, aes(x=shotclock)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=.5,colour="#663366", fill="#6699CC") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#666699")+
    geom_line(stat="density",colour="#6600CC")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p13,p14,ncol = 2)
```
_From the first plot we could see the major scores come from 0-5 meters and 22-25 meters which indicates players nowadays prefer layup, dunk or throw 3-point balls. From the second plot, we could see majority of players prefer to play organized attack, they are not will to save time or shot until the last second._  


## 4.4 C-tree analysis 
```{r}
library(party)
formula<-result~location+winlose+period+shotnumber+shotclock+dribble+touch+range+type+defence
dt<-ctree(formula,da,controls=ctree_control(minsplit=10,maxdepth=3))
plot(dt)
```
_From the C-tree, we could see the decisive relationship between variables, the shooting range large influence the other variables._   

## 4.5 Corelation Test
```{r}
shot <- da[,c(5:13)]
M = cor(shot,method = "spearman")
corrplot::corrplot(M,method = "ellipse")
```
_Corelation plot shows there exists obvious relationships between variables._    

_After i do these EDA plots, I believe the players shooting condition changes so much in recent years that i decide to analyze how their shooting results are influenced by other factor._  
_Based on NBA shot log dataset, I pick some of variables to build the model._  

# 5.Model analysis
## 5.1 General linear model
* Building model
The first model i use is general linear model, cause output of the model is bineary distribution, I use the glm function to build model. Model shows below:  
```{r include=FALSE}
model_1<-glm(result~location+shotclock+shotnumber+period+dribble+touch+range+defence+type+as.factor(name),family = binomial,da)
display(model_1)
```
* Model check
```{r}
binnedplot(predict(model_1,type="response"), residuals(model_1,type="response"))
```

* Interpretation
Choose my favorite player called Damian Lillard, his predicting function shows below:  

$$logit(result)=0.01 + 0.04location +0.01shotclock+0.02dribble-0.06touch-0.07range+0.11defence+0.11type+0.1(player) $$

_In this model, the majority of the coefficient are significant. But the according to the binned residual plot, there 
exists an obvious pattern, and the outliers are pretty large, hence this model needs improvement._  


## 5.2 Bayesian generlized linear model
The second model i do is bayesian generlized linear model, shows below:  
```{r,echo=FALSE}
model_2<-rstanarm::stan_glm(result ~ shotnumber+I(shotclock^2)+period+dribble+touch+touch*dribble+type*range+I(range^2)+I(defence^2),
                            family=binomial(),da,cores = 4)
```

* Model check
```{r}
rstanarm::pp_check(model_2)
```
_The simulation result show the output of my model is quite corespond with the observation which is 0 or 1, indicating the model fits quite well._  

## 5.3 Mutilevel model
### random intercept
```{r}
### m1
m1<-glmer(result~location+shotnumber+period+shotclock+dribble+touch+type+range+defence+
            dribble*touch+type*range+(1|name), data=da,family = binomial(),REML = T)
```

```{r}
### summary
summary(m1)
```
_From model1 we can see the most coefficients's p-value are quite small and they are significant. I set players name as pooling principle, so i get nearly 250 groups. From the resultm different players would have different shooting ability and different intercept. Additionally, there exists corelationships between these variables._  


```{r}
### check
pred1 = predict(m1,type = "link")
red1 = as.numeric(as.character(pred1))-da$result
com1 = data.frame(obs = da$result,pre = pred1) %>% pivot_longer(cols = 1:2,names_to = "type",values_to = "value")
red11 = sample(red1,4000)
### check visualization
car::qqPlot(red11)
plot(red11)+abline(h=mean(red11),lwd=4,col="skyblue")
binnedplot(fitted(m1),residuals(m1,type="response"))
```
_The residual plot shows the residuals are randomly distributed but mean value below 0. The qq-plot indicate the residual do not has more information. The model fits well in this way._  


### random slope
```{r}
### m2
m2<-glmer(result~location+shotnumber+shotclock+dribble+touch+type+range+defence+
          dribble*touch+type*range+(touch-1|name), 
          data=da,family = binomial(),REML = T)
```
_From model2 we can see the most coefficients's p-value are quite small and they are significant. I set players name as pooling principle,and the slope of range varys form different players. From the result different players would have different slope of range. We could see the range preference could be different because some players(like Lilard) prefer to shoot long distance ball. Additionally, there exists corelationships between these variables._ 
```{r}
### summary
summary(m2)
```

```{r}
### check
pred2 = predict(m2,type = "link")
red2 = as.numeric(as.character(pred2))-da$result
com2 = data.frame(obs = da$result,pre = pred1) %>% pivot_longer(cols = 1:2,names_to = "type",values_to = "value")
red22 = sample(red2,4000)
### check visualization
car::qqPlot(red22)
plot(red22)+abline(h=0,lwd=4,col="skyblue")
```


### random slope and random intercept
```{r}
### m3
m3<-glmer(result~location+shotnumber+shotclock+dribble+touch+type+range+defence+
          dribble*touch+type*range+(1+range|name), 
          data=da,family = binomial(),REML = T)
```

```{r}
### summary
summary(m3)
```
_From model3 we can see the most coefficients's p-value are quite small and they are significant. I set players name as pooling principle,and the slope of range varys form different players, the intercept could vary for different players. We could see the range preference could be different because some players(like Lilard) prefer to shoot long distance ball. Additionally, there exists corelationships between these variables._    
```{r}
### check
pred3 = predict(m3,type = "link")
red3 = as.numeric(as.character(pred3))-da$result
com3 = data.frame(obs = da$result,pre = pred1) %>% pivot_longer(cols = 1:2,names_to = "type",values_to = "value")
red33 = sample(red3,4000)
### check visualization
car::qqPlot(red33)
plot(red33)
```
_The qq-plot and residual plot shows the residuals are randomly normal distributed, while the mean of residual turn to be -1 which is abnormal._   

## 5.4 Model evaluation and selection
```{r}
anova(m2,m3,m1)
```
_From the anova test we can see the difference between three model are slight, while according to he AIC and BIC the model3's value is quite small. In addition, model 3 has more perfect performance in predicting shooting result._

The analysis i present in this report does good to predict a player's shooting performance during the game. From the glm model we could see a player could be influenced by various elements, such as shooting distance, defending distance, touch time, dribble number, and the like. After we pooling the players issue, we could see there exists slightly relationship between players and shooting distance/touch time/dribbles number.

* Limitation    
1. We all know the internal relations, mood, and other potential factors might impact the shooting result, these factors are differ from places and difficult to track.   
2. Regular season is quite different with the off season. Some team probably play less agressive in regular season because the risk of losing a single game is low. But when it comes to the play offs, all teams would spare no effort to chasing the championship, so some strategies might change.   

* Improvement  
1. The defensive strength could vary from teams, some teams has many tall players(LA Lakers), so teams are consist of low players(Portland Trail Blazers). Some information about opponents could largely improve the analysis quality.  
2. Players are easily to get injured during games and might absent several games if injured. They need time to go back to former condition after recovery. If more information could be collected, the analysis would be more accurate.  
3. NBA has the trading market machanism before a new season start, so each team’s player could vary through years, how to organize each player’s data needs to think again.

* Future direction
Some other method could be added into this analysis such as statistical learning to make this analysis more strengthful. Additionally, this analysis could be used into sports field(not limited to NBA), NFL, FIFA, hockey, and the like.

# 8.Appendix
## shooting period preference  
```{r,echo=FALSE}
### count number
a <- count(da,period)  
### adding vectors 
period <- c('1','2','3','4','5','6','7') 
number <- c(31307,28390,30024,26038,797,149,39)
### pieplot
piepercent<- paste(round(100*number/sum(number), 2), "%")
pie(number,labels=piepercent,col= c("skyblue","lightgreen","pink","lavender","lightyellow","lightgrey"),
    radius = 0.85,border="brown",lty=6,main='Shooting period proportion')
legend("topright",period,cex=0.5,fill=c("skyblue","lightgreen","pink","lavender","lightyellow","lightgrey"))
```
## How variables influence player's shoot result.    
```{r,echo=FALSE}
### range and distance(result)
ggplot(da,aes(range, defence))+geom_point(aes(color=factor(result)))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(mean(da$range)),color="#CC3300")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=mean(da$defence),color="#339999")+
  geom_smooth(color="#330033",type=3)
### touch and dribble(result)
ggplot(da,aes(dribble, touch))+geom_point(aes(color=factor(result)))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(mean(da$dribble)),color="#CC3300")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=mean(da$touch),color="#339999")+
  geom_smooth(color="#330033",type=3)+ylim(-10,20)
